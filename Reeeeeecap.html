  <h1>REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEECAP</h1>
  <p><em>
<p>The party left their home in search of supplies and found themselves trapped in mysterious fog.

<p>Tot Pot prayed to the Dawnfather, whose faint guidance helped them push forward.

<p>The group encountered two children, Rose and Thorn, crying outside a tall, dark house.

<p>The children begged the group to help their baby brother inside the house.

<p>Inside, the house sealed itself shut — no escape through doors or windows.

<p>The group explored multiple floors, finding elegant rooms hiding strange rot and decay.

<p>In the nursery, they discovered unsettling cult symbology and references to Strahd.

<p>The children’s ghosts revealed the truth: they had died there, long ago.

<p>Jade and Thorgar agreed to take the children’s remains to their rest, giving them gentle peace.

<p>Thorgar received Thorn’s stuffed bear — which still holds emotional + symbolic power.

<p>The group uncovered a hidden staircase leading down to the Death House dungeon.

<p>Chanting echoed endlessly: “One must die.”

<p>They found living quarters of a cult devoted to offering sacrifices to gain Strahd’s favor.

<p>They discovered a diary that detailed a cultist’s hope → doubt → horror as Gustav killed their friend.

<p>The party encountered traps, torture chambers, and disturbing remnants of ritual attempts.

<p>Jade acquired a *"Wand of Polymorph".

<p>Thorgar and Jade briefly disturbed a shadow statue of Strahd and were attacked by undead spirits.

<p>Katya and Tot Pot found footlocker treasures and Fang the pug (RIP sweet boy).

<p>After refusing to sacrifice anyone, the cult summoned Lorgarth, a shambling mound.

<p>The fight was brutal — but Thorgar landed the final strike, destroying the abomination.

<p>As the party escaped, the house began to collapse — walls shifting to kill them.

<p>They fought through skeletons in the catacombs and barely escaped the collapsing house.

<p>Once outside, the mists parted just enough to reveal the Village of Barovia.

<p>Morgantha, a kindly-seeming pastry seller, offered Dream Pastries (which are very not okay).

<p>The party met Ismark, son of the late Burgomaster, and learned about Ireena, marked by Strahd.

<p>They stayed in the Burgomaster’s mansion and learned that the father was dead.

<p>A night attack of wolves attempted to get at Ireena, reinforcing her need to leave.

<p>Jade learned that her mother Ruby was part of the Emerald Circle in Barovia — and died here.

<p>Ruby’s lingering spirit taught Jade that defeating Strahd requires severing the Heart of Sorrow.

<p>The group is now preparing to travel toward the Tser Pool Vistani encampment — where fate has more to reveal.

	<h1>Current Party-Wide Goals</h1>
	<h1>(Right Now in Vallaki)</h1>
	 <p>Protect Ireena while in Vallaki, where Strahd’s influence is subtle, not distant.

Investigate the Orphanage, where the shadow presence has taken root.

Confront the Shadow and prevent it from claiming a child (or a host).

Keep Vallaki from collapsing into hysteria — the town is one spark away from chaos.

Maintain trust with Ismark and the Vallaki townsfolk long enough to understand the political tension here.
