  <h1>REEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEECAP</h1>
  <p><em>
  The party left their home in search of supplies and found themselves trapped in mysterious fog.

Tot Pot prayed to the Dawnfather, whose faint guidance helped them push forward.

The group encountered two children, Rose and Thorn, crying outside a tall, dark house.

The children begged the group to help their baby brother inside the house.

Inside, the house sealed itself shut — no escape through doors or windows.

The group explored multiple floors, finding elegant rooms hiding strange rot and decay.

In the nursery, they discovered unsettling cult symbology and references to Strahd.

The children’s ghosts revealed the truth: they had died there, long ago.

Jade and Thorgar agreed to take the children’s remains to their rest, giving them gentle peace.

Thorgar received Thorn’s stuffed bear — which still holds emotional + symbolic power.

The group uncovered a hidden staircase leading down to the Death House dungeon.

Chanting echoed endlessly: “One must die.”

They found living quarters of a cult devoted to offering sacrifices to gain Strahd’s favor.

They discovered a diary that detailed a cultist’s hope → doubt → horror as Gustav killed their friend.

The party encountered traps, torture chambers, and disturbing remnants of ritual attempts.

Jade acquired a Wand of Polymorph.

Thorgar and Jade briefly disturbed a shadow statue of Strahd and were attacked by undead spirits.

Katya and Tot Pot found footlocker treasures and Fang the pug (RIP sweet boy).

After refusing to sacrifice anyone, the cult summoned Lorgarth, a shambling mound.

The fight was brutal — but Thorgar landed the final strike, destroying the abomination.

As the party escaped, the house began to collapse — walls shifting to kill them.

They fought through skeletons in the catacombs and barely escaped the collapsing house.

Once outside, the mists parted just enough to reveal the Village of Barovia.

Morgantha, a kindly-seeming pastry seller, offered Dream Pastries (which are very not okay).

The party met Ismark, son of the late Burgomaster, and learned about Ireena, marked by Strahd.

They stayed in the Burgomaster’s mansion and learned that the father was dead.

A night attack of wolves attempted to get at Ireena, reinforcing her need to leave.

Jade learned that her mother Ruby was part of the Emerald Circle in Barovia — and died here.

Ruby’s lingering spirit taught Jade that defeating Strahd requires severing the Heart of Sorrow.

The group is now preparing to travel toward the Tser Pool Vistani encampment — where fate has more to reveal.

	<h1>Current Party-Wide Goals (Right Now in Vallaki)</h1>
	 <p>Protect Ireena while in Vallaki, where Strahd’s influence is subtle, not distant.

Investigate the Orphanage, where the shadow presence has taken root.

Confront the Shadow and prevent it from claiming a child (or a host).

Keep Vallaki from collapsing into hysteria — the town is one spark away from chaos.

Maintain trust with Ismark and the Vallaki townsfolk long enough to understand the political tension here.
